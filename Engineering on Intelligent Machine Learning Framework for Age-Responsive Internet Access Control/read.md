Abstract:

The Age-Responsive Internet Access Control System is
an intelligent program designed to control internet
access based on a user's age, leveraging machine
learning model. This system captures real-time face data
from users, processes it using pre-trained machine
learning models, and accurately predicts their age by
passing through pre-trained machine learning models.
Then, the internet feature will be allowed according to
the userâ€™s age.
